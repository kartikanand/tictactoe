### Description
From [Wikipedia:MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
> Minimax (sometimes MinMax or MM[1]) is a decision rule used in decision theory, game
> theory, statistics and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case
> (maximum loss) scenario. Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory,
> covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make
> simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general
> decision making in the presence of uncertainty.
